# Draft-Order-Randomizer
A basic Python program that will randomize Fantasy Football draft order given any list size.

The randomizer dynamically uses the length of the given list of league members
to generate a new randomized order. Just replace the names in the program with
names you want to use and run the program. There does not need to be 12 members; 
I just used that many for my own purposes.
